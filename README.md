# Battleship Game
This is a remake of the original board game Battleship. 
The end goal is to allow two players from different connections to be able to play Battleship online and communicate with each  other through a chatting system. It is currently in development with some features needed to be worked on.

## TODO:
* Send coordinates to server and back to players
* Fix rotating ships bug
* Fix hit boxes for ships
* Remove unecessary object creations
* Add chatbox
* Refine other operations
